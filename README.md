My first ever custom ros package! 
Very proud of this accomplishment. 

Learnt a lot about ros from how to use custom message from other packages to learning how to edit the cmake file.
Also managed to learn about classes and objects extensively (not yet, but i have someone who can explain it to me inshallah)
