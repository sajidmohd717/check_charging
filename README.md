My first ever custom ros package! 
Very proud of this accomplishment. 
It might be a small project, but its big in my eyes :D fml

Learnt a lot about ros from how to use custom message from other packages to learning how to edit the cmake file.
Also managed to learn about classes and objects extensively (not yet, but i have someone who can explain it to me inshallah)
